Learning the no-code best-practice way of using Git

Hi!

Siddharth here. I'm here to add all sorts of code to Git. From Analytics and Visualization work via Python and R to Web Development via JavaScript (with HTML and CSS ofcourse!) and more eventually.

Have been an Analytics vendor since 2015 but all that work is owned by companies I worked for, hence starting things fresh for myself (quite late, I must add). However, slow progress is progress too.
